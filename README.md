# Recon

Command to Run: $recon domain filename
This is a simple bash script for Recon.
The script basically finds all the subdomain for a particular domain and create a file domain_filename.
This bash script uses assetfinder and Sublist3r to find the Subdomains.
Thanks @tomnomnom and @aboul3la for this awesome tool.
